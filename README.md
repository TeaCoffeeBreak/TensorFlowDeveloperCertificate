What is TensorFlow ?
- End to end Platform for ML
- Write fast deep learning code in Python/Ohter accessible languages (able to run on a GPU/TPU)
- Able to access many pre-buit deep learning models (TensorFlow Hub)
- Whole stack
-- preprocess data
-- model data
-- deploy model in (your) application


Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning, particularly using Google's own TensorFlow software
